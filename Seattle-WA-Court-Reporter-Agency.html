This is not going to be a complete list, however, it will give you the basics to choose the best court reporting service for your needs.</p><p>1) Experienced And Qualified Court Reporters</p><p>This is one that is not going to need any explanation. You want to have the best court reporter available for your depositions, it only makes sense. Of course, they should have the mandatory CSR license, but what else should there be?</p><p>You want to find a court reporter who arrives in a timely manner.</p><p>The court reporter should arrive in professional dress attire.</p><p>They should have an easy going attitude and not seem overly stressed.</p><p>A competent court reporter should be fully confident during the swearing in process.</p><p>Are they able to offer an accurate and confident read through?</p><p>Once the deposition concludes are they going to be polite and respectful when asked for information and spellings?</p><p>Are they a good ambassador towards their profession?</p><p>2) Superior Supporting Staff</p><p>The court reporting agency that you ultimately choose, must offer outstanding customer service. You never want to call during business hours and get one of those long-winded, annoying voice mail centers. The agency should be staffed with friendly people willing to help you.</p><p>3) Professional Online Website</p><p>There is no reason that a court reporting agency should not have a website in this day and age. It should feature an area for client login and deposition scheduling. A good court reporting agency website is going to allow for online scheduling with a customer login area that is perfect for you as a customer to save time. Just remember that it is never a good idea to schedule online with a court reporting agency that does not offer a confirmation number.</p><p>4) Superior Transcripts</p><p>When you get a transcript delivered from your court reporting agency, it is essential that it is high quality and free of errors.</p><p>The transcript must meet the minimum requirements set forth by the state license board.</p><p>It should be able to unbind easily or have a plastic spindle melted on to it.</p><p>It is always wise to request a 3-hole punched transcript. This is going to allow for much easier internal copying.</p><p>5) Do They Offer Services You Need?</p><p>There are going to be times when you need to get a deposition in the middle of nowhere, it is important that the agency you choose has reporters that travel. In addition, does the agency offer a local presence that includes conference suites for easier access? You want to dig deep in this regard, while many agencies will say they offer statewide service, they only have one physical location.</p><p>6) Are They Truly A One Stop Shop?</p><p>We all schedules and are busy, there should be no need to have to deal with multiple vendors. When choosing a court reporting firm, it is essential to find one that is going to handle as many aspects of the deposition as possible. You should be able to schedule the court reporter, suite, interpreter, and videographer all at one time. If you are dealing with far too many vendors, it is time to look elsewhere! You need to find a "one-stop shop" to make your life easier.</p><p>7) Satisfaction Guaranteed Every Single Time</p><p>While working with any court reporting agency, you want to minimize all risks with a new agency, this it is essential to seek out a company that offers a guarantee. If you are working with or going to work with a company and they refuse to offer a written guarantee for any aspect of the work they perform, it is past time to seek out a new agency.</p><p>8) Reputation</p><p>How often do you seek out referrals for service-oriented tasks? More than likely all of the time. SO what is stopping you with a court reporting agency? You want to find one that has excellent testimonials and positive reviews online.</p><p>NAEGELI DEPOSITION AND TRIAL<br />601 Union St #1624, <br />Seattle, WA 98101<br />(206) 622-3376</p><br><br><iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d2689.8158663435697!2d-122.33466368436936!3d47.610269979184956!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x54906ab44d91c81f%3A0x2433e9a6e4af2b4f!2sNAEGELI+DEPOSITION+AND+TRIAL!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sus!4v1530712471504" width="600" height="450" frameborder="0" style="border:0" allowfullscreen></iframe><p></p><br></body><br></html>
